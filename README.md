# Spring Boot Security with JWT Application

Simple demo app that shows off working with JWT tokens to register and/or log-in users allowing them to hit some
controller endpoints depending upon their Roles/Authorities.

To run the application, copy the `application-local.yml.sample` to `application-local.yml` and update the path to your
data folder.
