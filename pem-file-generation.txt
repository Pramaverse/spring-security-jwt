To generate PEM files use the following commands.

1. openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem 2048
2. openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out public.pem
3. openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in keypair.pem -out private.pem

Use the private.pem and public.pem files as private and public key respectively.
Store them under classpath and mention them in application.properties/application.yml files.
